# Application state models

This directory holds the source-to-model inventory and Quint models required by
[PRD section 12](../docs/slop-product-requirements.md#12-state-correctness-and-quint-verification).
The models cover frontend routes, accounts and wallet sessions, project
admission and revisions, private reports and awards, notifications, Points and
disputes, Slopbot review and scoring, vetting and evidence, payment contracts
and workers, fee handling, referral code, contributor tools, snapshots and
release. External provider and chain behavior remain separate trust boundaries.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `models/<domain>/*.qnt` | Finite Quint models, one folder per domain. Model names are unique across folders. |
| `inventory.json` | Generated census of production sources, their linked models and lexical state candidates. |
| `state-catalog.json` | Generated list of declared lifecycle string unions and SQL state constraints. |
| `stateless.json` | Reviewed reasons why a source holds no independent state. |
| `tlc.json` | TLC worker and JVM settings for `formal:verify`. |
| `lemmascript/` | Dafny proof artifacts for the selected `verified-*` TypeScript modules. |
| `tests/` | Implementation conformance tests that run actual migrations and handlers. |

Domains: `api`, `contracts`, `contributor`, `fees`, `payments`, `points`,
`referrals`, `release`, `rewards`, `slopbot`, `tooling`, `ui` and `vetting`.

## Commands

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run formal:check
bun run formal:verify
node scripts/check-formal.mjs --model=MODEL_NAME
node scripts/check-formal.mjs --verify --model=MODEL_NAME
SLOP_QUINT_TRANSLATOR_TEST=1 bun test scripts/quint-local-translator.test.ts
bun run formal:inventory:update
```

`formal:check` requires a current inventory with zero unmapped sources, a
current state catalog, then typechecks each model, runs its scenarios and
samples 500 seeded traces of up to 60 steps. `formal:verify` explores each
finite state graph with TLC through the lockfile-pinned Quint. Translation
needs Java 21 and the pinned Apalache distribution. The runner uses a local
parser process instead of the upstream gRPC launcher, pins the JAR bytes and
supervises each process group. Commands fail on violations, errors or timeouts.
The Java 21 CI job enables the translator's real TLC regressions; without the
environment flag those cases are reported as skipped.

## Model conventions

- Begin each model with one `// @source path` line per production file it
  abstracts. The runner binds each result to the model and every mapped source;
  a change to either during a run fails that run.
- Export `init`, `step` and `invariant`, plus named `run *Test` reachability
  scenarios. A model without a scenario fails the check.
- Name temporal properties `*Property`; TLC checks them. TLC deadlock detection
  is disabled, so cover terminal and stalled behavior with explicit scenarios
  and progress properties.
- State scheduler and external-service fairness assumptions beside each
  progress property. A timeout or retry bound must settle visibly; fairness
  must not assume that a payment, provider request or human approval succeeds.
- Record finite bounds and abstractions in the model's comments.

## Inventory and review

A source is `mapped-abstraction` when a model names it,
`reviewed-no-independent-state` when `stateless.json` gives a reason, and
otherwise `pending`. A mapping is a review index, not proof that every source
branch refines the model. Refreshing the inventory alone cannot turn an
unreviewed source into accepted coverage. After reviewing a source or model
change, run `bun run formal:inventory:update` and commit both indexes.

Unmentioned literals in `state-catalog.json` are review leads, not proof of a
missing transition, and a matching literal is not proof of coverage. Boolean,
numeric, cross-process and implicit state still require manual review.

## Evidence

Results, exact commands, source and model hashes and tool versions are written
to the ignored `evidence/formal/` directory. Attach the relevant receipts to the
issue or PR. Distinguish sampled simulation, exhaustive finite exploration,
implementation conformance and live integration; do not count partial coverage
as complete.

## Open work and assumptions

- Run the full code, model, database, contract and browser gates against one
  combined revision. Earlier per-checkpoint passes do not certify a later head.
- Finish the private Anvil and Solana browser lanes and the repeated wallet
  matrix. Local Solana acceptance must reach a passing finalized run; a newly
  compiled native program needs its own native evidence.
- LemmaScript proofs cover only the selected `verified-*` modules; other
  runtime functions remain unproved.
- Finite models, lexical state discovery, selected function proofs and passing
  workflows do not prove the absence of every application state error. Local
  provider and chain fixtures do not establish production deployment, live
  providers, devices, wallets or settlement availability.

## Method

The [Quint language guide](https://quint.sh/docs/language-basics) defines actions
and nondeterministic transitions. The
[property guide](https://quint.sh/docs/checking-properties) distinguishes
simulation, witnesses, invariants and model checking. The
[temporal operator reference](https://github.com/quint-co/quint/blob/main/docs/content/docs/builtin.md)
defines fairness and eventual progress. Models are finite, independently
checkable families with explicit cross-family assumptions, followed by
implementation conformance through actual workflow entry points.
